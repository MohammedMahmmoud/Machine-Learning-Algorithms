# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repo contains some machine learning algorithms that I've implemented which are:
* Linear Regression form scratch without using sklearn library.   
  * library used are (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot,  pconst).
* logistic Regression form scratch without using sklearn library.  
  * library used are (pandas, numpy, pconst).
